First you need to download VScode, which I already did. Its a simple download, you just got to go to https://code.visualstudio.com/, follow the instructions and download it from there. Then, if you have Windows, you must go to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse, to find out how to Install OpenSSH. However, if you have a Mac then you already have SSH and can move on.

## Remotely Connecting

The next step is then connecting to a remote host. First you need to open your terminal(Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option) in VScode and type in "ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu," of which the "zz" part will be different for everybody. If this is your first time then a message will pop up saying "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?" and just type in "yes." Then type in your UCSD student login password(You will not be able to see it getting typed in for security reasons). Then you are logged in remotly to another computer,
