# CSE15L Week 4 Lab Report
This is the Lab Report for Week 4 of CSE15L, due on the 24th of April, 2022. In this lab we were debugging and improving a program, by making a total of 3 changes to it.

## Original Code:

## First Change

The first change we made was creatinf if-statments that would indicate that if the

The next step is then connecting to a remote host. First you need to open your terminal(Terminal → New Terminal menu option) in VScode and type in "```ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu```," of which the "```zz```" part will be different for everybody. If this is your first time then a message will pop up saying "```Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?```" and just type in "```yes```." Then type in your UCSD student login password(You will not be able to see it getting typed in for security reasons). Then you are logged in remotly to another computer.


## Third Change

Next we're going to try some command options available to us. The most basic ones are:

● ```cd```: moves you to your home directory

● ```cd ~```: moves you to the directory specified, such as "cd Documents"

● ```ls```: lists the files in the current directory

● ```ls -a```: lists all files, including those normally invisible in UNIX

● ```ls -lat```: lists all files and information of those files

● ```mkdir```: it creates a new subdirectory named new_dir

● ```exit```: to reutnr back to your computer




## Conclusion

This then concluded our 3rd CSE15L lab on the process and significance there was on debugging. It really was us a look in to the tediousness and length of time needed into getting a program to work.
